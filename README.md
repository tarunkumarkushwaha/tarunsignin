# Welcome to Login app by tarun

This is a simple Login App built using React Native. The app utilizes Formik for form handling and Yup for form validation. I kept it clean and focussed more on features.

## How to get start

1. Install dependencies

   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```
    npx expo start
   ```

## Features
1. Context API: used for state management and authentication.
2. Formik: used for handling form state, inputs, and submission.
3. Yup: used for validating input fields such as email, password, and other form fields.
4. async storage : persistent login even after reload 
5. async storage : remembers email password if remember me #selected
